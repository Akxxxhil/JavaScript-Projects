Project Title: To-Do List Application

Description:
Create a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the list.

Requirements:

1. **UI Design**: Design a simple and intuitive user interface for the to-do list using HTML and CSS. Include areas for displaying tasks, an input field for adding new tasks, and buttons for marking tasks as completed or removing them.

2. **Task Management**: Implement functionality using JavaScript to manage tasks. Users should be able to:
   - Add a new task by typing in the input field and pressing Enter or clicking a button.
   - Display the added task in the list of tasks.
   - Mark a task as completed by clicking a checkbox or button associated with the task.
   - Remove a task from the list by clicking a delete button or icon next to the task.

3. **Persistence**: Implement local storage functionality using JavaScript so that the to-do list persists even after the page is refreshed or closed and reopened.

4. **Optional Features**: You can include additional features to enhance the application, such as:
   - Editing tasks
   - Sorting tasks by priority or due date
   - Adding due dates to tasks
   - Filtering tasks (e.g., by completed/incomplete)

5. **Testing and Validation**: Test your application thoroughly to ensure that it functions as expected. Validate user inputs and handle edge cases gracefully.

6. **Documentation**: Provide clear comments in your code to explain the functionality of each part of the application.

7. **Styling**: Apply CSS styling to make your application visually appealing and user-friendly.

8. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that your application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

9. **Extra Credit**: Implement additional features or functionalities beyond the basic requirements to further improve your application.

Feel free to modify or expand upon these requirements based on your skill level and interests. Have fun coding!
